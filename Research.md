<h1>The genetic basis of intralocus sexual conflict</h1>
<p>The divergent reproductive roles of males and females generate sexually antagonistic selection, with opposing trait values favoured in each sex. Responses to these selective pressures are however constrained by the sexes' shared genome, leading to 'intralocus sexual conflict' (IASC) or 'sexual antagonism', where different alleles at given loci are favoured by selection in each sex. IASC is widespread among animals and plants and imposes an important evolutionary constraint on adaptation. However, despite our increasing understanding of the taxonomic prevalence of IASC and the traits affected, the genetic loci underlying this antagonism remain almost entirely unknown. To address this shortcoming I am combining experimental evolution, next-generation sequencing and bionformatics in a bid to identify causal sexually antagonistic loci across the <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> genome.</p>

<h1>Y-chromosome variation and fitness</h1>
<p>Alongside my work on IASC I am also investigating Y-chromosome variation and how it relates to fitness in <i>D. melanogaster</i>. The Y-chromosome is a degraded, repeat-rich, and gene-poor chromosome; however, despite its seeming insignificance, recent studies have found that it can explain global changes in gene expression and that there is Y-linked epistatic variation for male fitness in <i>D. melanogaster</i>. My work is focused on characterising to what extent the Y-chromosome modulates fitness-related gene expression and what the evolutionary consequences of this are.</p>
